    <div class="question">Should I save gold for interest?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      NO! There is no interest in this game (unless playing the Alchemist God).
      Try to use as much of your gold as possible.
    </div>
    <div class="question">How do I upgrade spells?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      By buying duplicate copies of the same spell. Getting a spell to 1 or 2
      points strengthens the spell as it would in DOTA. A 3 point spell in
      Ability Arena is equivalent to a max level spell in DOTA. Points 4, 5, 7,
      8 do not affect the spell in any way.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Instead, your spell becomes Super tier at 6 points, and Gaben tier at 9
      points. The bonuses granted by these are listed on the spell, and are
      different for each spell.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Are the same spells in every game?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      No. There are more than 150 spells in total, but only 100 are available 
      each game the rest are banned at the start of each game. 
      No banned spells are accessible to any player. You can open the
      Spell Deck before choosing your God to see if there are spells available
      which synergize with your choice of God.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Can I equip items or select talents?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      No. Items and talents often come in the form of Super and Gaben upgrades
      for your abilities. For example, Walrus Punch grants Silver Edge at
      Super and 20% chance to proc at Gaben (similar to level 25 talent).
      Gaining an item includes both the stats they provide AND their
      passive/active effects.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What does upgrading my shop do?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Upgrading your shop gives you more spell slots in the shop. A level 1 shop
      offers 4 spells, while a level 2 shop offers 6. At level 3, instead of
      gaining more spell slots, you begin to see ultimate abilities in the shop.
      Levels 4 and 5 only increase your spell slots. Some God abilities are
      affected by your shop level. The cost to upgrade your shop decreases by 1
      each round.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Outside of the game, where can I see all the Gods and Spells?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      God info including their powers and how to unlock them can be found 
      <a href="https://abilityarena.com/learn/gods" target="_blank">here</a>
      or under the Learn menu option.

    <div class="question">Will you continue to balance the game?</div>
    <div class="answer">YES!</div>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <div class="question">What’s with the letters next to the heroes?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      The letters represent the hero’s rank such that (S>A>B>C>D), where S is
      the strongest and D is the weakest. This is determined by things such as
      melee/range, stat gain, base stats, and attack range.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Is an S tier hero always better than lower tier heroes?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      No! You wouldn’t want Primal Beast (S tier) being your spellcaster, but
      maybe Tinker or Zeus (D tier) instead.
    </div>
    <div class="question">How do I get more heroes?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Every player will get a new hero body at rounds 1, 3, 6, 9, 12. These are
      guaranteed to be a certain rank: D at 1, C at 3, B at 6, A at 9, and S at
      12. When selecting a body, you can click ALT to compare stats with all 3
      bodies at once.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What does rerolling my hero body do?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Rerolling your hero body costs 2 gold and gives you a choice of 3 random
      heroes to replace it with. You will always be offered one strength, one
      agility, and one intelligence hero. They can be from any tier, meaning you
      can even get an S tier body early in the game.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Rerolling your hero is important, but should be secondary to managing your
      spells. When rerolling your hero, they will retain their equipped spells
      at no cost. If you do not select a hero, you will be given a random one of
      the 3 choices. If the preparation phase ends while rerolling a hero, it
      will give you a random choice. Be careful not to reroll your hero when the
      fighting phase is merely a second away.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Does it matter where I place my heroes?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      A good placement is important for success. You don’t want your backline to
      be vulnerable, nor do you want your frontliners to be ignored. It’s also
      important to consider AOE abilities that your opponent might have.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What does the spell deck do?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      The spell deck shows you what spells may show up in the shop. Every player
      selects spells from this same pool, and the number on the top right corner
      of each spell tells you how many “copies” of the spell remain in the pool.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      A spell with more copies left will naturally be more frequently offered in
      the shop, so you can use this to know which spells you can try to get to
      Gaben. When a player is eliminated, all of their spells are returned to
      the pool.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Does my God influence how I should play?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Yes, but not completely. You should be aware of your God ability and what
      benefits it offers to you. Utilize this to your advantage, but don’t
      narrow your choices too much.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Who worked on this game?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Here’s a list of
      <a href="https://abilityarena.com/credits" target="_blank">Our Team</a>
    </div>
    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
    <div class="question">
      How can I tell what spells you changed from regular Dota?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Some spells have been slightly changed to be more balanced in our mode. If
      you’ve picked one of these spells, you will notice a “Difference to Dota”
      text at the bottom of the tooltip, which explains any changes we made from
      the base game. This text may also contain AI rules for specific spells
      (ie: Empower & Life Break)
    </div>
    <div class="question">Can I move spells between heroes?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Yes, you can move spells to other heroes at the cost of 1 gold. Bench
      spells can move to a hero without any cost, but moving a spell from a hero
      to the bench costs 1 gold.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Why do my heroes switch targets?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Heroes will attack the closest enemy, so if enemy heroes move around then
      your units may switch targets. Some spells have unique AI which doesn’t
      follow this rule. Heroes will not attack summons.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Is there any way to know my next opponent?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      No. The only information you have regarding this is that you won’t face
      the same opponent twice in a row until there aren’t enough players to
      choose from. The game generally tries to select a variety of opponents.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Why is my opponent glowing white?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      You are playing their ghost. This occurs when there are an odd number of
      players. You can never be matched up against a player that has already
      lost. A ghost enemy will deal damage to you, but you will not deal damage
      to the original player if you win.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      My God involves getting more Spell points, what does that mean?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Spell points are simply the amount of duplicate spells you have in total.
      Depending on the God you are playing, spell points can be very important.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      How do spell charges work with bodies (ie Finger or Culling Blade stacks)
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      All charges are tied to the ability itself. If you move the ability to a
      different hero, all of those charges will transfer over as well.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Can a hero equip multiple ultimate abilities?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      No. Each hero is only allowed one ultimate ability. Only the Donkey
      Aghanim God has an ability which circumvents this.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Why does Impetus not proc Essence Flux</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Because that is how it is coded in regular Dota (Arcane Orb is a specific
      exception in the base game)
    </div>
    <div class="question">How is round damage determined?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      5 + (Round Number / 3.8) + (Number of Heroes * Round Number / 3.8)
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Rounds to the closest whole number (for example 5.5 goes to 6 and 5.49 goes to 5).
    </div>
    <div class="question">Are there hotkeys in the game (ie: Re-rolling)?</div>
    <div class="answer">Yes, if you hold ALT, it will show them all.</div>
    <h2>Monetization</h2>
    <div class="question">How do I unlock more Gods?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Everyone has the same starter Gods. Aghanim God can be unlocked by
      completing the 7-day newcomer quest. Shopkeeper and Tinker can be
      purchased with coins.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      There are also Gods tied to the Battle Pass every season, which you can
      unlock for free by playing and leveling your Battle Pass. The rest of the 
      Gods can be obtained from God chests.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Purchasing a PLUS subscription will also give you a selection of Gods that 
      will rotate each month. The PLUS Gods can drop from chests as well.
    </div>
    <div class="question">How do drops work from the unique god chest (Galaxy God Chest)?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      The chest will drop a random God that you do not own with escalating odds to drop a Rare.
      You will not get duplicates until you own every common God.
      Duplicate gods count as progress towards a gold card.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What will seasons look like going forward?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Seasons will typically be two months long. With each season the following
      will be added:
      <ul>
        <li>New spells rotating in and out</li>
        <li>
          New Gods
        </li>
        <li>
          New rotation for PLUS Gods 
        </li>
        <li>
          A brand new Battle Pass themed around one of the new Gods. The Battle
          Pass will always include Finishers, Arenas, and Avatars based on the
          themed God.
        </li>
        <li>Leaderboard rank reset</li>
        <li>New cosmetics to drop from chests</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Will my subscription to PLUS be auto-renewed every month?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">No</div>
    <div class="question">I have a promo code, where can I enter it?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      In-game you need to click the store icon at the top left, and then the
      promo code button at the bottom left of the window
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Will my regular Dota cosmetics be shown in this game?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">Yup!</div>
    <div class="question">Does my Terrain influence how I should play?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Terrains and many other things (avatar accessories, hats, etc.) are purely
      cosmetic and don’t influence gameplay at all.
    </div>
    <div class="question">How do I redeem my consumables?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Open the Armory tab either in-game or on this site. The Armory contains
      all your consumables and cosmetics.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Will I get anything for being a high rank at the end of the season?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Yes, you will get exclusive cosmetics for this. Stay tuned for details.
    </div>
    <h2>Bugs</h2>
    <div class="question">Why can't I reconnect to a game if I get disconnected?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      This, unfortunately, is a Valve issue that affects most custom games. We've 
      reached out to them and are awaiting a response.
      If you disconnect early in the game then you will be able to reconnect without issue.
    </div>
    <div class="question">The spell deck is showing the wrong spells or there is nothing in the banned spells list!</div>
    <div class="answer">
      This is a visual bug which can be fixed by disconnecting and reconnecting, make sure to only do this early in the game (see the bug above).
